Discuss the latest scraped stories.

# Description
This project was an exercise for me to get familiar with MongoDB and with the concept and implementation of web scraping.

Transistor is a place to read and comment on the latest tech news (from [The Tech Report](https://techreport.com/)). At the core of this application is a web scraper function. This function is used to scrape the latest stories from [The Tech Report](https://techreport.com/) and display them on Transistor's UI.
